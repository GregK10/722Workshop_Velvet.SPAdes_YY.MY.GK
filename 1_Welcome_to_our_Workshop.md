# Welcome to our workshop (2021-03-31)
Editors: GK, YF, and MY 

### Before we get into it, we want you to all be prepared

First, let's create a directory in your scratch folder. Feel free to name it whatever you like
```
mkdir first_student_workshop
cd first_student_workshop
```
Next let's transfer the two fastq files we will be working with. These are paired end reads so there are 2 files
The Fastq file provided can be accessed from one of our scratch directories
```
cp /2/scratch/manyou/workshop/*.fastq .
```
While we are in our ```first_student_workshop``` directory, lets make 2 additional directories for our output files from both asspeblers, as well as a directory for our QUAST analysis.
```mkdir SPAdes_out ; mkdir velvet_out ; mkdir quast```
#### We are all set to run both of de novo asemblers. Click [here](https://github.com/GregK10/722Workshop_Velvet.SPAdes_YY.MY.GK/blob/main/2_SPAdes.md) for the SPAdes portion.
