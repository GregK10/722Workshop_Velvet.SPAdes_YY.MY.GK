# 722Workshop_Velvet.SPAdes_YY.MY.GK

This Github repopsitory is a workshop project for our 722 class in 2021.

# Purpose of the project
Our intentions for this project is to demonstrate _de novo_ whole genome assembly by comparing two assemblers:
- ## [SPAdes] (https://github.com/GregK10/722Workshop_Velvet.SPAdes_YY.MY.GK/blob/c14be8d1df9be212f49c5b074c0caec6e304f4a4/2_SPAdes.md)
- ## Velvet

After we generate the fasta files from SPAdes and Velvet, we will examine the summary statistics of the assemblies using QUAST.
