# 722Workshop_Velvet.SPAdes_YY.MY.GK

This Github repopsitory is a workshop project for our 722 class in 2021.

# Purpose of the project
Our intentions for this project is to demonstrate _de novo_ whole genome assembly by comparing two assemblers:
- #SPAdes
- #Velvet

After we generate the fasta files from SPAdes and Velvet, we will examine the summary statistics of the assemblies using QUAST.
